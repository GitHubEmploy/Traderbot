What is Traderbot?
-------------------
Traderbot is software designed to automatically trade cryptocurrency. 

Automated trading, also known as algorithmic trading, can be defined as a system of computers programmed to follow specific 
instructions on how to place trade orders. [1]_ This system is used to generate profits at a speed and frequency that is 
impossible for human traders. Some advantages of algorithmic trading include the mitigation of emotional decision making, 
improved order entry speeds, consistency, and backtesting. [2]_

Traderbot's software is open source and all documents relating to this project can be found here.

.. [1] **Algorithmic trading** (automated trading, black-box trading, or simply algo-trading) is the process of using computers programmed to follow a defined set of instructions for placing a trade in order to generate profits at a speed and frequency that is impossible for a human trader. The defined sets of rules are based on timing, price, quantity or any mathematical model. Apart from profit opportunities for the trader, algo-trading makes markets more liquid and makes trading more systematic by ruling out emotional human impacts on trading activities. `Basics of Algorithmic Trading: Concepts and Examples | Investopedia <http://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/101014/basics-algorithmic-trading-concepts-and-examples.asp#ixzz4uEOJRHuR>`_

.. [2] One of the big reasons that algorithmic trading has become so popular is because of the advantages that it holds over trading manually. The **advantages of algo trading** are related to speed, accuracy, and reduced costs. `Advantages of Algorithmic Trading | Nasdaq.com Forex Education <http://www.nasdaq.com/forex/education/advantages-of-algo-trading.aspx>`_
